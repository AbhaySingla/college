- I connected the SenseHat to my pi and uploaded the coade on the pi, and the LED started blinking.<br>
- I did not checked weather the sensors where collecting the data, because i wanted to start to work on my sensor instead.
- I connected my PIR sensor to the pi.
- For the first few tries the sensor was not working, I got so fed up that i unplugged everything and listend to "What About Us, By Pink"
- When i started again i realised that i was looking at the pi pins from the opposite side so instead of pin 26 i was giving the digital output to pin 25.
- Once i figured that out I checked and tested the sensor, set its sensitivity and time delay.
- Now i have figure how attache the camera module and use PIR sensor as a switch for it.

In the class i mostly worked on conecting my PI to the humber WiFi.<br>
I was not able to do it, i tried what was provided in the sence hat repository and also a lot of stuff on the internet,<br>
but it was of no use, so i am just using the wired internet connection.
