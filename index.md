- I connected the SenseHat to my pi and uploaded the coade on the pi, and the LED started blinking.<br>
- I did not checked weather the sensors where collecting the data, because i wanted to start to work on my sensor instead.

In the class i mostly worked on conecting my PI to the humber WiFi.<br>
I was not able to do it, i tried what was provided in the sence hat repository and also a lot of stuff on the internet,<br>
but it was of no use, so i am just using the wired internet connection.


## Things I did during and before the strike
