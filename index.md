## January 7, 2018
The [Progress Report](https://github.com/AbhaySingla/college/blob/master/Progress%20report.docx) is on github.

## January 3, 2018
I have uploaded my [final code](https://github.com/AbhaySingla/college/blob/master/PirPlusCamera2.py) on github.

## January 2, 2018
I made a few changes in the code i wrote and made it better. Also i housed my pir sensor and the camera module in the 3d printed cases. Unfortunately i could not make the video for it but here are some pics.<br>

## December 16, 2017
I made a priliminary 30 second video, for the submission on monday but i have send the prints for the 3d print to the prototype lab and according to Vlad they will be available hopefully by thursday and then i will make the compleate video. <br>
Until then this is the priliminary one:[Video](https://github.com/AbhaySingla/college/blob/master/30sec%20Clip.mp4)

## December 12, 2017
- Made the group playcard.
- Wrote the script for the 30 seconds video.<br>
-- word file for the script: [Script](https://github.com/AbhaySingla/college/blob/master/30min%20script.docx)<br>

## December 4,2017
 - The Ghmain is working fine without any errors, in the class in front of the instructor, Hardware clock and BME 280 was not working till the time instructor visited my workstation for the first time. I was able to detect and work with the BME280 sensor with the given BME280.py code while i was trying to debug the hardware clock.
 - FINALY i formated my sd card using the sd card formatter and re- installed Rasbian in it. I cloned the StudentSenseHat Repository fron GitHub to my Pi and checked for the sensors to work.<br>

Because all of this was done fairly quickly, i also tested my PIR sensor because i had already emailed the working code to myself bufore the sd card started to act funny.

## December 2, 2017
I was trying to add OpenCV to the already working camera module and in the process i somehow managed to delete my home directory. I rebooted my Pi but no luck, so i removed the sd card from the pi and plugged it in my computer to see that the pi has split my drive in 4 diffrent drives. I formated all of them and now i am STUCK.<br> 
I have been working on adding the AI for more than 5 hours now. I think i am reaching the end of today's session. I will now pack the stuff up and will start working on it with a fresh mind on monday. 

## November 28, 2017
- I connected the SenseHat to my pi and uploaded the coade on the pi, and the LED started blinking.<br>
- I did not checked weather the sensors where collecting the data, because i wanted to start to work on my sensor instead.
- I connected my PIR sensor to the pi.
- For the first few tries the sensor was not working, I got so fed up that i unplugged everything and listned to "What About Us, By Pink"
- When i started again i realised that i was looking at the pi pins from the opposite side so instead of pin 26 i was giving the digital output to pin 25.
- Once i figured that out I checked and tested the sensor, set its sensitivity and time delay.
- Now i have figure how attache the camera module and use PIR sensor as a switch for it.

## November 27, 2017
In the class i mostly worked on conecting my PI to the humber WiFi.<br>
I was not able to do it, i tried what was provided in the sence hat repository and also a lot of stuff on the internet,<br>
but it was of no use, so i am just using the wired internet connection.


## Things I did during and before the strike
- Acquired all the parts for my project.
- Printed my Sense Hat
- Soldered my Sense Hat components
- Installed OS on my Raspberry PI
